Shared Memory, Message Passing, and Hybrid  Merge Sort: UPC, OpenMP, MPI and Hybrid Implementations

This project demonstrates the implementation of a parallel merge sort algorithm implemented using several approaches.
The programming languages and frameworks used, include:
  - OpenMP
  - MPI
  - MPI-3 RMA
  - Hybrid MPI and OpenMP
  
The MPI and OpenMP implementations were developed by Prof. [Atanas Radenski](http://www1.chapman.edu/~radenski/)
of Chapman University.  His work is described in [_Shared Memory, Message Passing, and Hybrid Merge Sorts
for Standalone and Clustered SMPs_](http://www1.chapman.edu/~radenski/research/papers/mergesort-pdpta11.pdf)

Techniques and Applications, CSREA Press, 2011, pp. 367-373).
