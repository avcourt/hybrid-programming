The following results were collected on a dual processor
Intel Xeon 5690 3.5 GHz system with 48G of memory.
There are 12 total cores and 24 Hyper Threads.

For hybrid runs, the following rules for deriving the number of
OMP threads (NT) and MPI or UPC processes (P) were used.

    If NP <= 8 Then P=2, NT=NP/2
    If NP >  8 Then P=4, NT=NP/4

This system is shared memory only, thus the MPI and UPC runs
are single node only.

Each test run sorted 100 million (100,000,000) random 32-bit integers.

The results are sorted on the NP=16 column.
